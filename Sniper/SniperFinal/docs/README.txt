Game Play:
When the player enters the world, at any time, the user can press K to start the game. When the game is started, the player has the indicated amount of time to hit 30 targets. 

There are 10 targets in each level. Once 10 targets are hit , the level will change, and the player's target count will increase to 10 again.

To prevent players from continuously shooting at targets, only one bullet will be rendered at a time. If the player shoots again while the bullet is still in the air, the bullet is reset, and a new bullet is created. 

But most of all don't forget to have FUN!
